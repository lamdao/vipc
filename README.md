## vipc - High-performance 3D Image Processing Core Libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Descriptions

This is a set of libraries that provides high-performace processing
for 3D image volume/stack. It is also the core/back-end library of
[vpiy](https://github.com/lamdao/vipy) framework in Python. The basic
features of vpic are 3D image manipulation, filtering, morphological
transformations. It also has some advanced features, such as volume
Tensor decompositions, Fast wavelet transforms. It was designed and
developed as back-end libraries for Python/Matlab/IDL to speed-up
basic image processing tasks supporting for image analysis. It can
utilize full power of multi-core systems to get the job done as quick
as possible.
